# dumbBoids
im making boids, but in php for the calculations and p5js for the graphics. never mix these two. trust me. this is the worst spaghetti code i've ever written

# WARNINGS
Oh yeh also I'm fairly certain that it can't run unless your folder already includes a local php server or something in it's path. Like, I tried to run it in a different folder, and it broke pretty bad, so i just ummm, don't do that. It works here in this folder on my machine though, which is all i need it to do. oh yeah, the window size is also specified to match my custom window size of the screen of my pc, and may be wildly different from yours. Sooo just... be warned about that.

# The idea
I got started on this idea because iw anted to learn php, and i wanted to make boids, so i figured it would be expedient to just mix the two. </br>
I was mistaken... </br>
